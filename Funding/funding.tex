\begin{funding}

 I gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Research Council under grant number 741112 \emph{An Information Theoretic Approach to Improving the Reliability of Weather and Climate Simulations} and from the UK National Environmental Researc Council (NERC) under grant number NE/L002612/1.

 I would like to thank the whole Julia community for an uncountable effort to develop a very modern high performance computing language that is high-level, easy to learn and was proven to be increadibly useful for reduced precision simulations. I also would like to thank everybody who developed the matplotlib plotting library, which was used for every figure in this report.
