\label{sec:open}

\subsection{SoftPosit.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer, M Giordano, C Leong
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/SoftPosit.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.3.0
\end{itemize}

SoftPosit.jl is a software emulator for posit arithmetic. The package exports the Posit8, Posit16, Posit32 number types among other non-standard types, as well as arithmetic operations, conversions and additional functionality. The package is a wrapper for the SoftPosit C-library written by C Leong.

\subsection{StochasticRounding.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/StochasticRounding.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.1.0
\end{itemize}

StochasticRounding.jl is a software emulator for stochastic rounding in the Float32, Float16 and BFloat16 number formats. Both 16bit implementations rely on conversion to and from Float32 and stochastic rounding is only applied for arithmetic operations in the conversion back to 16bit. Float32 with stochastic rounding uses Float64 internally. Xoroshio128Plus is used as a high-performance random number generator.

\subsection{ShallowWaters.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/ShallowWaters.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.3.0
\end{itemize}

ShallowWaters.jl is a shallow water model with a focus on type-flexibility and 16bit number formats, which allows for integration of the shallow water equations with arbitrary number formats as long as arithmetics and conversions are implemented. ShallowWaters also allows for mixed-precision and reduced precision communication.

ShallowWaters is fully-explicit with an energy and enstrophy conserving advection scheme and a Smagorinsky-like biharmonic diffusion operator. Tracer advection is implemented with a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme. Runge-Kutta 4th-order is used for pressure, advective and Coriolis terms and the continuity equation. Semi-implicit time stepping for diffusion and bottom friction. Boundary conditions are either periodic (only in x direction) or non-periodic super-slip, free-slip, partial-slip, or no-slip. Output via NetCDF.

\subsection{Sherlogs.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/Sherlogs.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.1.0
\end{itemize}

Sherlogs.jl provides a number format Sherlog64 that behaves like Float64, but inspects your code by logging all arithmetic results into a 16bit bitpattern histogram during calculation. Sherlogs can be used to identify the largest or smallest number occuring in your functions, and where algorithmic bottlenecks are that limit the ability for your functions to run in low precision. A 32bit version is provided as Sherlog32, which behaves like Float32. A 16bit version is provided as Sherlog16{T}, which uses T for computations as well as for logging.

\subsection{Sonums.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/Sonums.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.2.0
\end{itemize}

Sonums.jl is a software emulator for Sonums - the Self-Organizing NUMbers. A number format that learns from data. Sonum8 is the 8bit version, Sonum16 for 16bit computations.  The package exports number types, conversions and arithmetics. Sonums conversions are based on binary tree search, and arithmetics are based on table lookups. Training can be done via maximum entropy or minimising the rounding error.

\subsection{Float8s.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer, J Sarnoff
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/Float8s.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.1.0
\end{itemize}

Float8s.jl is a software emulator for a 8bit floating-point format, with 3 exponent and 4 significant bits. The package provides the \texttt{Float8} number type, as well as arithmetic operations, conversions and additional functionality. The software emulator is based on conversion to and from Float32, which is used for arithmetic operations.

\subsection{LogFixPoint16s.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/LogFixPoint16s.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.1.0
\end{itemize}

LogFixPoint16s.jl is a software emulator for 16-bit logarithmic fixed-point numbers with 7 signed integer bits and 8 fraction bits. The package provides the \texttt{LogFixPoint16} number type, as well as arithmetic operations, conversions and additional functionality. The software emulator is based on either integer addition or look-up tables and is therefore a comparably fast emulator.

\subsection{Lorenz96.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/Lorenz96.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.3.0
\end{itemize}

Lorenz96.jl is a type-flexible one-level Lorenz 1996 model, which supports any number type, as long as conversions to and from Float64 and arithmetics are defined. Different number types can be defined for prognostic variables and calculations on the right-hand side, with automatic conversion on every time step. The equations are scaled such that the dynamic range of numbers can be changed. The scaled equations are written division-free.

\subsection{Lorenz63.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/Lorenz63.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.2.0
\end{itemize}

Lorenz63.jl is a type-flexible Lorenz 1963 model, which supports any number type, as long as conversions to and from Float64 and arithmetics are defined. The Lorenz equations are scaled such that the dynamic range of numbers can be changed. The scaled equations are written division-free.

\subsection{Jenks.jl}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
    \item Authors: M Kloewer
    \item URL: github.com/milankl/Jenks.jl
    \item License: MIT
    \item Version: 0.1.0
\end{itemize}

Jenks.jl is the Jenks Natural Breaks Optimization, a data clustering method to minimise in-class variance or L1 rounding error. Jenks provides a data classification algorithm that groups one dimensional data to minimize an in-class error norm from the class mean but maximizes the same error norm between different classes.
