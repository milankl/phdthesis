I am very grateful for the support and very fruitful discussions with my supervisors Tim Palmer and Peter D\"{u}ben, and especially for the freedom to develop my own ideas.

 I would like to thank the whole Julia community for an uncountable effort to develop a very modern high performance computing language that is high-level, easy to learn and was proven to be increadibly useful for reduced precision simulations. I also would like to thank everybody who developed the matplotlib plotting library, which was used for every figure in this report.
